      name specific to that SourceType. Not all values are applicable - a
      validation error will be returned for incorrect values.<br>For each
      SourceType, the value should be:<br>ACCOUNT_LINK - If account linking was
      enabled for the browser SSO, the value must be 'Local User ID', unless it
      has been overridden in PingFederate's server configuration.<br>ADAPTER -
      The value is one of the attributes of the IdP Adapter.<br>ASSERTION - The
      value is one of the attributes coming from the SAML

      'VirtualServerId' or 'AuthenticatingAuthority' or
      'DefaultPersistentGrantLifetime']<br>CLAIMS - Attributes provided by the
      OIDC Provider.<br>CUSTOM_DATA_STORE - The value is one of the attributes
      returned by this custom data store.<br>EXPRESSION - The value is an OGNL
      expression.<br>EXTENDED_CLIENT_METADATA - The value is from an OAuth
      extended client metadata parameter. This source type is deprecated and has
      been replaced by EXTENDED_PROPERTIES.<br>EXTENDED_PROPERTIES - The value
      is from an OAuth Client's extended property.<br>IDP_CONNECTION - The value
      is one of the attributes passed in by the IdP
      connection.<br>JDBC_DATA_STORE - The value is one of the column names
      returned from the JDBC attribute source.<br>LDAP_DATA_STORE - The value is
      one of the LDAP attributes supported by your LDAP data
      store.<br>MAPPED_ATTRIBUTES - The value is the name of one of the mapped
      attributes that is defined in the associated attribute
      mapping.<br>OAUTH_PERSISTENT_GRANT - The value is one of the attributes
      from the persistent grant.<br>PASSWORD_CREDENTIAL_VALIDATOR - The value is
      one of the attributes of the PCV.<br>NO_MAPPING - A placeholder value to
      indicate that an attribute currently has no mapped source.TEXT - A
      hardcoded value that is used to populate the corresponding
      attribute.<br>TOKEN - The value is one of the token attributes.<br>REQUEST

      contract or the request contract for Ws-Trust.<br>TRACKED_HTTP_PARAMS -
      The value is from the original request parameters.<br>SUBJECT_TOKEN - The
      value is one of the OAuth 2.0 Token exchange subject_token
      attributes.<br>ACTOR_TOKEN - The value is one of the OAuth 2.0 Token
      exchange actor_token attributes.<br>TOKEN_EXCHANGE_PROCESSOR_POLICY - The
      value is one of the attributes coming from a Token Exchange Processor
      policy.
